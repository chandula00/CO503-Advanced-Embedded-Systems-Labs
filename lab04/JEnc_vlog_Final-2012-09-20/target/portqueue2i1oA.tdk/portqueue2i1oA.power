 
----------------------------- DISCLAIMER ------------------------------
The power reported here is an estimate of the actual power.
The actual power should be obtained using hardware power analysis tools.
The actual power depends on many factors beyond the control of the
estimator. These factors include but are not limited to 
technology process, standard cell library, synthesis tool quality,
synthesis scripts, optimization switches, MHz / performance goal,
and power goal. Furthermore, the power reported here is in pJ/cycle (uW/MHz)
for 0.13 micron lv technology.

Every attempt has been made to provide an accurate estimate, however,
the actual power may vary. TIE developer is advised to rely on the 
power estimate during the early phases of the design and validate the
estimated power using hardware synthesis tool as design attains maturity.
